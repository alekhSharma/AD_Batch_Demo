# AD_Batch_Demo

1. Started working on the LWC code + custom metadata types, but DML operations arenâ€™t allowed on custom metadata in the Partner or Enterprise APIs. Each change triggering a record creation is treated as a deployment. MDT not showing in the flow as well.

2. Started with custom setting, faced the issue - Number of DML statements: 1 out of 0 ******* CLOSE TO LIMIT. As the imperative apex method has the    @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)

3. Faced the issue - SetupOwnerId duplicates value on record with id: 00D5j00000DqR1NEAV, as the custom setting is Hierarhy. List custom setting is greyed out.
